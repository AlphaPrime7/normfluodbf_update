# normfluodbf_update

- An update to normfluodbf pushed as a separate branch. This is the most difficult part of the update and it seems to be working just fine.

- I did not want to mess with the package so I avoided running any code within the original repository.

- This is the update to read and clean DAT files. The process works but since I did not use DAT files during my research, I am shocked as to why the cleaned data returns 12o rows
  as opposed to 40 rows or tuples.
