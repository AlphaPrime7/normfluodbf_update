#' Title: A function to obtain attribute names for experimental samples
#' @description
#' The function takes a clean data frame, data on the experiment and returns the column names that match the FLUOstar plate reader.
#'
#' @author Tingwei Adeck
#' @param df A clean data frame obtained from the large scale delineation of samples.
#' @param rows_used A character vector representing the plate rows used; eg ru <- c('A','B','C'). can be used in sequence or out of sequence.
#' @param cols_used A numeric vector representing the plate columns used; eg cu <- c(1,2,3,4). keep as null if all the columns were used or columns are used in sequence.
#' @param user_specific_labels A character vector with specific sample labels based on the plate setup
#'
#'
#' @return Returns column names that will be added to the normalized data frame that contains all samples
#' @export
#' @note This function is a subordinate function and follows a sequence of actions. In this package, this function cannot be used as a standalone.
#' Also, some work is needed here on the part of the user because i have no access to their setup file.
#' A function that takes the setup excel file from the user should be part of the next update to prevent the user from doing much work.
#' The program is always going to need rows_used. The user can choose to specify columns used but typically if things are in sequence then everything should be fine.
#' The extreme case is an extreme unorthodox plate (hard to know when this will happen) and then the user must either specify rows used directly or the user is given a prompt by R to input rows used.
